## New Int Patternlab dev with Vagrant & Chef
We've now setup our patternlab development enviroment using [Vagrant][1] & [Chef][3] for collaboration, demonstration and deployment reasons.
### Setting up and running
#### Cloning Repository
IMPORTANT NOTE: If you have an encrypted home directory, make sure you don't put the files there, otherwise you'll end up in a world of pain when you try to setup NFS!!!  
First thing to do is to browser to where you want to work on your local machine and clone this repo. Here is some example code for making a folder in your home directory call *ni_dev* and cloning this repo to there.
```shell
$ sudo mkdir ~/ni_dev
$ cd ~/ni_dev
$ sudo git clone https://github.com/CreativeOutbreak/ni-patternlab-vagrant.git
```
If you don't have [git][4] installed, install it! ;)
Then run the previous code.
#### Setting up & running Vagrant
IMPORTANT NOTE: If you have an encrypted home directory, make sure you don't put the files there, otherwise you'll end up in a world of pain when you try to setup NFS!!!  
Now you've got your working directory set up, it's time to get the Vagrant server running.  
[Vagrant][6] uses [VirtualBox][5], so you need to download both of them to start with.  
You may also find the [Vagrant instalation page][7] and [getting started guid][8] helpfull.  Vagrant is verry well documented!

Now you've got them both install we'll move onto running the Vagrant box.

#### Running Vagrant
Fortunately, this couldn't really be simpler!  If you're not already in the working directory, browser to it `cd ~/ni_dev` and then run `vagrant up`. This may take a while the first time, as it need to download a linux box and then set it all up with the [Chef][3] config.  
NOTE: *Should take around 10 minutes, but may be longer if you have a slow connection.  It will tell you when it's done.*

##### VirtualBox shared file
IMPORTANT NOTE: If you have an encrypted home directory, make sure you don't put the files there, otherwise you'll end up in a world of pain when you try to setup NFS!!!
IMPORTANT NOTE: NFS does not work on Windows machine!  If you're planning on using Windows you'll have to deal with it running slow... You should probably be used to that by now though ;)     
VirtualBox shared directories are slow. We can fix the problem by using NFS synced folders. Unfortunately NFS doesnâ€™t work on Windows.  
To install NFS run:
```
$ sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server
```
Then change the type of synced folders to nfs in your config.json.  
Find next lines inside your config.json.
```
"synced_folders": [
    {
      "host_path": "data/",
      "guest_path": "/var/www",
      "type": "default"
    }
  ],
```
Replace default with nfs.
```
"type": "nfs"
```
Then reload Vagrant.
```
$ vagrant reload
```
NOTE:  The config file has probably already been changed to use NFS.  
### All Done!  
You should now be able to browse to [drupal8.dev][12] and see the Drupal 8 site.

### Sharing with other devices
OK, I know I just said you where all done, but when is that really ever the truth! ;)  
This next step is very easy and also very usefull!  Vagrant offers a free cloud service for sharing you Vagrant box with other devices anywhere that has an internet connection.  
This is particularly helpfull if you want to test it on you mobile device or do a demo at an Annual Meeting...  
You can make a free cloud account at [Vagrant Cloud][14] or if you're feeling lazy, you can uses my one:
```
username: pjstew
password: schlumpf
```

now you know that and you've got you Vagrant box running, you can just type the following code and it will give you a cloud url to share.
```
$ vagrant login
$ vagrant share
```

That's it for now.
